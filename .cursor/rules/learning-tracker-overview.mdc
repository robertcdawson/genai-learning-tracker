# Learning Tracker App Overview

## Project Description
A Next.js-based learning management application that helps users track and manage their learning lessons. It's a simple, single-page application with a modern dark theme UI.

## Core Features
- **Lesson Management**: Add new lessons with titles (auto-assigned defaults: status "Todo", priority 3, review level 0)
- **Progress Tracking**: KPI display showing total lessons, completed lessons, and progress percentage
- **Lesson Organization**: Table view displaying lesson titles and statuses
- **Data Persistence**: Browser localStorage for data persistence between sessions

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.5 with React 18
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with dark theme
- **Data Storage**: Browser localStorage via custom `useLocalStorage` hook

## Data Structure
Each lesson includes comprehensive metadata:
- Basic info: id, title, course, status, priority
- Organization: tags, notes
- Time tracking: estimated minutes, actual minutes
- Review system: review level, last reviewed date, next review date
- Timestamps: created/updated dates

## Current State
MVP with basic functionality implemented. Data structure supports advanced features like spaced repetition, but UI only shows basic lesson management.

## Key Files
- `app/page.tsx`: Main application page
- `components/LessonForm.tsx`: Form for adding new lessons
- `components/KPIs.tsx`: Progress indicators display
- `components/LessonTable.tsx`: Table view of lessons
- `components/types.ts`: TypeScript type definitions
- `components/useLocalStorage.ts`: Custom hook for localStorage persistence

## Development Notes
- Code appears minified/compressed (single-line format)
- Built for production deployment
- Supports advanced features in data model but basic UI implementation
